For my final project I want to do a flappy bird inspired game. For the challenges I think I'll face is trying to balance the difficulty in the game making it challenging but not enough for it to be frustrating.
I think I'll set myself some deadlines or check points each and every week so I can say consistent with my work while not pressuring myself either. 
So far I have only made the base of the game, currently tuning the difficulty and figuring out what theme I want to make the game.
